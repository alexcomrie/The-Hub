# Profile Type Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement three distinct profile types with different functionalities:
1. Product Sales (default)
2. Product Listing (showcase only)
3. Job Listing (recruitment)

## Requirements

### 1. Job Listing Data
- Reuse product sheet with different column mappings:
  - Column A: Business Name
  - Column B: Invite Message
  - Column C: Position & Salary
  - Column D: Job Purpose & Responsibility
  - Column E: Qualification & Experience
  - Column F: Additional Information
  - Column G: Instructions to Apply
  - Column H: Address (optional)
  - Column I: Email (optional)
  - Column J: Contact Number (optional)
  - Column K: Business Logo/Image
- Job listing profiles indicate that users can view job postings from different businesses
- No categories for job listings

### 2. Product Listing
- Show prices in product listing profiles
- Maintain product categories
- Additional display fields/changes needed (to be specified in implementation)

### 3. Profile Type Changes
- Allow switching between Product Sales and Product Listing only
- Switching between these types only deactivates/activates the ordering system
- Job Listing requires creating a new profile
- No data migration needed for type switches
