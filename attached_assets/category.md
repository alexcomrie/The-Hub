A new column titled “Category” will be added to the Profile sheet. This column identifies which business categories each entry belongs to. Multiple categories can be assigned to a single business seperated by a comma",".
As a result, the app's entry point will be updated to launch into a new Category Screen:
- 🧭 The Category Screen will display all active categories as card views.
- Each card will include:
- The name of the main category
- An image/icon representing the main category
- When a user selects a category, they will be directed to the Business List Screen, which shows only businesses tagged under that selected category.
🔍 Only categories that are actively assigned to businesses in the Profile sheet will appear in the Category Screen.
Example:
If Business #1 is tagged “Deli Counters & Sandwich Bars,” 
Business #2 is “Tour Operators & Guides,” 
and Business #3 is “Dentists & Dental Hygienists,” 
then only the 🍔 Quick Eats & Takeaway Food Services, 🌍 Travel & Tourism Services and 🩺 Private Health & Medical Services category cards will be visible.
On the Business List Screen, two enhancements will be made:
- A search bar to allow users to search by business name.
- A filter feature to sort businesses by:
- Type
- Category
- Name
- And other relevant attributes

🔖 Category Structure Overview
The following is a list of main categories that will be added to the app.
Beneath each main category is a set of subcategories, which will be used to tag individual businesses on the Business List Screen.
📌 How categories are used:
- Main categories will be featured as cards on the Category Screen—each with the Main categories name and icon.
- Subcategories will be assigned to businesses to indicate their specific type within a broader category.
- On the Business List Screen, the main category tag will determine which businesses are shown when filtering or selecting a category


the card view will display only the main categories along with the description:
