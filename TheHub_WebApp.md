# TheHub Web App - Technical Analysis

## Overview

TheHub is a web application designed to connect small-to-medium businesses, artisans, and skilled individuals with customers in a centralized platform. It serves as an online directory and marketplace that allows businesses to showcase their products and services while enabling customers to browse, discover, and place orders. The application is optimized for mobile devices and implements SEO best practices to improve discoverability.

## Application Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
  - Custom module resolution for Netlify deployment
  - Optimized dependency bundling with explicit paths
  - SSR configuration for improved SEO
  - Manual chunk splitting for performance
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- **State Management**: 
  - React Context API for application state (cart)
  - React Query for server state and data fetching
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for cart persistence

### Backend

- **Server**: Minimal Express.js server
- **Primary Function**: Serving the frontend application
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - Health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
  - Placeholder for potential future expansion
- **Data Source**: Google Sheets (accessed directly from the client)
- **Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for user data
- **SEO**: Server-side sitemap generation for improved search engine indexing
- **Vite Integration**: Custom Vite server setup for development and production

### Data Flow

1. Client-side application fetches business data directly from Google Sheets CSV
   - Data is cached in localStorage for offline access and performance
   - BusinessService handles data fetching, parsing, and validation
2. Product data is fetched from business-specific Google Sheets URLs
   - Products are organized by category within each business
   - Image URLs are processed to handle direct access and CORS issues
3. Data is validated using Zod schemas to ensure type safety
4. React Query manages server state, caching, and refetching strategies
5. User interactions update local state through Context API (cart, settings)
6. Cart data is persisted in localStorage with business-specific isolation
7. SEO metadata is dynamically generated for each page
8. Sitemap is generated server-side to improve search engine indexing
